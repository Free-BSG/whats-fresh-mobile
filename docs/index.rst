Welcome to Oregon's Catch documentation!
========================================

What is Oregon's Catch?
-----------------------

	Oregon's Catch is an app that will help you find local vendors with fresh seafood for sale on the Oregon Coast. On the home page you can specify where and what type of seafood you want to search for, as well as specify whether the results will be displayed as a list of vendors or products. After you have entered your search parameters and hit the go button, you will be navigated to a page that shows you a list and map of your search results. You can then explore more details about each search result by selecting a product or vendor from the map or list.

How can you search for products or vendors?
-------------------------------------------

	 You will be able to search either by your current location, a specific city on the coast, or a specific type of seafood. When you search by a location (either your current location or a city on the coast) you will get a list of vendors near that location. If you search by a type of seafood, you will be given a list of the different types of preparations of that seafood. You can use one of the two location fields (current location or specified city) and a type of seafood to narrow your search, in which case you will be presented with a list of preparations of that type of seafood, that happen to be near you or the city you specified. If you want to see a list of different types of seafood near you or in a city you have selected, you can use the products checkbox to get a list of products near you. On the other hand if you want to know what vendors carry a specific type of seafood, you can check the vendor checkbox when you search for a type of seafood.
