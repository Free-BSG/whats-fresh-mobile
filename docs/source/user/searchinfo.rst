How can you search for products or vendors?
===========================================

	 You will be able to search either by your current location, a specific city on the coast, or a specific type of seafood. When you search by a location (either your current location or a city on the coast) you will get a list of vendors near that location. If you search by a type of seafood, you will be given a list of the different types of preparations of that seafood. You can use one of the two location fields (current location or specified city) and a type of seafood to narrow your search, in which case you will be presented with a list of preparations of that type of seafood, that happen to be near you or the city you specified. If you want to see a list of different types of seafood near you or in a city you have selected, you can use the products checkbox to get a list of products near you. On the other hand if you want to know what vendors carry a specific type of seafood, you can check the vendor checkbox when you search for a type of seafood.
