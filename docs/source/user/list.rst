List Page
=========

Once Oregon's Catch has finished searching for vendors or merchandise,
the results are displayed on the list page. This page displays the search
results in either one of two modes: vendors or products, depending on
which sorting option was selected on the home page. 

If "Vendors" was selected on the home page, the page will display a
list of vendors and a map with nodes indicating these vendor's
locations. Users may select a vendor from either the map or the list
to see more information about that specific vendor.

If "Products" was selected on the home page, the page will display a
list of products and a map with nodes indicating locations where those
products can be purchased. Users may select a product from the list to
see more information about that specific product item. Users may also
select a map node to see more information about the vendor that
carries the selected product at that map node's location.
