List Page Documentation
=======================
This page displays your search results in two different ways. First there is a map that shows where the vendors associated with your search results are located. Then there is a list of your search results below the map. If you cick on a list item, the item you selected will be highlighted as well as the map nodes that correspond with the list item. If you click on a map node an info window will appear above the marker. Then you can click on the corresponding button to lead to a page with more detailed information about the vendor or product.
